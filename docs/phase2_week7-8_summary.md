# Phase 2 Week 7-8 Completion Summary

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Battle Format System (`src/battle_format.rs`)
- ✅ Implemented `BattleFormat` enum with Singles, Doubles, VGC, and Custom variants
- ✅ Created `BattleRules` struct defining:
  - Party size (total Pokemon)
  - Team size (Pokemon brought to battle)
  - Active Pokemon per side
  - Format clauses (Species, Sleep, Freeze, OHKO, Evasion, Item)
- ✅ Implemented `FormatClause` enum for rule enforcement
- ✅ Created `BattlePosition` struct for multi-Pokemon positioning
- ✅ Implemented `TargetResolver` trait and `FormatTargetResolver` for move targeting
- ✅ Added `FormatValidator` for team validation

### 2. Format Configuration System (`src/format_config.rs`)
- ✅ Created `FormatConfig` struct for banned/restricted lists
- ✅ Implemented predefined configurations:
  - Singles OU (with typical bans)
  - Doubles OU (with doubles-specific bans)
  - VGC 2024 Regulation G (with restricted legendaries)
- ✅ Created `BattleFormatFactory` for easy format creation
- ✅ Added `ConfigBasedValidator` for configuration-based validation

### 3. Format Enforcement (`src/format_enforcement.rs`)
- ✅ Implemented `FormatEnforcer` for runtime rule enforcement
- ✅ Added instruction validation (Sleep/Freeze clause checks)
- ✅ Added move choice validation (OHKO/Evasion clause checks)
- ✅ Created `FormatStateTracker` to monitor clause violations
- ✅ Added comprehensive unit tests

### 4. Format Initialization (`src/format_init.rs`)
- ✅ Created `BattleInitializer` for format-aware battle setup
- ✅ Implemented format detection heuristics
- ✅ Added format string parsing
- ✅ Created `BattleContext` for managing format state during battle
- ✅ Defined `StateFormatExt` trait for future State integration

## Key Design Decisions

1. **MoveTarget Integration**: Used the complete MoveTarget enum from `data/types.rs` (16 variants) that maps 1:1 with rustemon/PokeAPI
2. **Validation Approach**: Used Vec instead of HashSet for duplicate checking due to missing Hash/Eq traits on existing enums
3. **Modular Design**: Separated format definition, configuration, enforcement, and initialization into distinct modules
4. **Extensibility**: Custom format support allows for future format additions without core changes

## Next Steps for Phase 2

### Week 9-10: Battle State Overhaul
- [ ] Extend `State` struct for multi-Pokemon battles
- [ ] Redesign `BattleSide` for variable active Pokemon
- [ ] Implement new `BattlePosition` and targeting systems
- [ ] Update state serialization for new format

### Week 11-12: Move Targeting Implementation
- [ ] Integrate rustemon move targets directly into engine
- [ ] Implement format-specific target resolution (singles vs doubles)
- [ ] Add target validation and auto-targeting logic
- [ ] Create targeting resolution engine for rustemon MoveTarget enum

The foundation for multi-format support is now in place. The next phase will focus on modifying the core battle state to support multiple active Pokemon per side.
